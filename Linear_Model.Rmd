Linear models are fundamental tools in statistics and machine learning, widely 
used for understanding the relationship between variables and making 
predictions. A simple way of implementing the model is by using the 
'lm'-function in R. While using the 'lm'-function is convenient it does not show
us how a linear model works. To comprehend this more clearly, I have provided an R-code for building a linear model. Three functions have been constructed for
analysing the data using the model. The R-Code is provided
below the text describing the code.

The main function has 4 arguments specified. 'data', 'dep', 'indep', and 'intercept'.The idea is that 'data' is the argument for the data set one wishes 
to analyse. 'dep' is the name of the response vector, it is a vector with one element (the name of the dependent variable). 'indep' is a vector of names corresponding to the names of the independent variables. The argument 'intercept' determines whether the model has an intercept or not.

To ensure that the function operates correctly, several if-statements have been implemented following the specification of the input parameters. These 
if-statements serve as conditions for the function to proceed. If any of these conditions are not met, the function will terminate, and an error message will 
be generated.

The first if-statement verifies that the input for 'data' is a tibble. The 
second if-statement checks that the input for 'dep' is a character vector corresponding to a column in the 'data' tibble. The third if-statement ensures 
that there is only one name in the character vector of 'dep'. The fourth if-statement confirms that there is at least one element in the character vector provided as the input for 'indep'.

Additionally, the fifth if-statement validates that all entries in the character vector of 'indep' correspond to columns in the 'data' tibble. Lastly, the sixth if-statement halts the execution of the code if the input for 'intercept' is not
a logical vector."

More if-statements could be included to further safeguard against misuse 
of the function. However, for our current purpose, these conditions suffice.

Since the function makes computations using the input for 'dep' and 'indep', denoting 'dep' as 'y' and 'indep' as 'X' is more convenient. The function 
extracts the name of these inputs from the data frame (input for 'data'), and 
then denotes them as 'y' and 'X' respectively.

If the user of the function wishes to use an intercept there is an if-statement
conditioning that. If an intercept is included, a column of ones is combined columnwise with 'X' (also known as the design matrix).

The function outputs a list containing regression-related objects, including estimated regression coefficients ('beta'), fitted values ('fitted'), residuals 
('residuals'), standard deviation of residuals ('sigma'), variance of regression coefficients ('se'), and the response vector ('y'). While the code provides mathematical computations for these, detailed explanations of the calculations 
are not included. The list of objects in the output can all be calculated using
the response vector 'y' and the design matrix 'X'.

When the function output is printed, R generates a lengthy message. Though this 
long message is not insightful, useful information can still be extracted. To facilitate interpretation, both a plot- and a print-function is developed.

The print function, when applied to the output of the main function, extracts estimated regression coefficients and their corresponding standard errors. These
are then intelligibly displayed: variable names and intercept are listed in the first row, regression coefficients in the second, and standard errors in the 
third.

The plot function, when applied to the output of the main function, visualizes the fitted and the true values in a scatterplot.

At this stage the model can be implemented. In the code, the model is built
using the economics-data from ggplot2. The input for 'dep' is "pce", 
c("unemploy", "pop", "psavert") for 'indep', and intercept is left on default
(TRUE).

'ggplot2' and 'tibble' was used when building the functions. The code for
installing and loading these is provided below:

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("tibble")
library(tibble)

linear_regression <- function(data, dep, indep, intercept = TRUE)
{
  
  if (!is_tibble(data)) {stop("the input 'data' must be a tibble")}
  
  if (!dep %in% names(data)) {stop("No dependent variable with that name in your tibble of data")} #If there is no variable named 'dep' in 'data' stop.
  
  if(!(is.character(dep) && length(dep) == 1)) {
    stop("'dep' must be a character vector of length 1")}
  
  if (!(is.character(indep) && length(indep) > 0)) {
    stop("'indep' must be a character vector of length 1 or greater.")}
  
  if (!all(indep %in% names(data))) {stop("No independet variables with that name in your tibble of data")}
  
   if (!is.logical(intercept)) {stop("The input 'intercept' must be a logical variable")}
  
  X <- as.matrix(data[,indep])
  y <- as.matrix(data[[dep]])
  
  if (intercept == TRUE) {
    rows_in_vector_of_1s <- nrow(X)  
    Intercept <- rep(1, rows_in_vector_of_1s) 
    X <- cbind(Intercept, X) 
  }
  
  XT <- t(X) 
  XTXI <- solve(XT %*% X) 
  beta <- XTXI %*% XT %*% y 
  fitted <- X%*%beta
  residuals <- y-fitted 
  sum_of_squared_residuals <- sum(residuals^2) 
  sigma <- sqrt(sum_of_squared_residuals /(nrow(X)-ncol(X)))  
  vector_of_variances_of_betas <- diag((sigma^2)*XTXI) 
  se <- sqrt(vector_of_variances_of_betas) 
  
  output <- list(beta = beta, se = se, residuals = residuals, fitted = fitted, 
  sigma = sigma, dep = dep, indep = indep, y = y)
  return(output)} 

print <- function(the_list){ 
  beta <- the_list$beta
  se <- the_list$se
  my_matrix <- rbind(t(beta), se)
  rownames(my_matrix) <- c("coefficient", "se")
  return(my_matrix)}

plot <- function(the_list){ 
  fitted <- the_list$fitted
  y <- the_list$y
  newdf <- data.frame(Actual = y, Fitted = fitted)
  ggplot(newdf, aes(x = (1:length(y)))) +
    geom_point(aes(y = Actual, color = "Actual"), size = 1) +
    geom_point(aes(y = Fitted, colour = "Fitted"), size = 1) +
    labs(title = "Actual and fitted values (sorted)", x = "Order", y = "Value") +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual" = "turquoise", "Fitted" = "orange", name = "Variable")) +
    theme_minimal()
}



obj <- linear_regression(ggplot2::economics,
                         dep = "pce",
                         indep = c("unemploy", "pop", "psavert"))


print(obj)
plot(obj)
```
